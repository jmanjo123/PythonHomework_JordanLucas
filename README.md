# PythonHomework_JordanLucas

Consists of Two different Python Programs (PyBank & PyPoll)


PyBank:
You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv.

The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.


PyPoll:

The total number of votes cast
    A complete list of candidates who received votes
    The percentage of votes each candidate won
    The total number of votes each candidate won
    The winner of the election based on popular vote.
              
    In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
